<H3>Learn web developemnt fundamentals</H3>
<p>The best first step to becoming a Web Developer is to start learning web development fundamentals, including
         an understanding of HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), 
         CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript.</p>

<h3>Choose a web development specialization</h3>
<p>Front-End Developer. A Front-End Developer works on the “client-side” of web development,
     meaning any portion of the site or app that users interact with. This can include a site’s layout,
      design, and the way users interact with it.
    Back-End Developer. A Back-End Developer works on the “server-side” of web development.
     This is focused on the way a site functions and can include databases, servers, networks and hosting, and more.
    Full-Stack Developer.
     A Full-Stack Developer is familiar with both front-and back-end development and works with both sides of a website.</p>

 <h3>Learn basic programming languages</h3>
 <p>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)
    JavaScript.</p>
    
    <h3>Build projects to gain experience</h3>
    <p>With a grasp of the basics in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
       and a foundation of programming skills,
       you’re ready to begin building. As you go,
       you’ll gain experience using an ever-growing set of Web Developer skills.
       Some of these are technical skills, or “hard” skills,
       like programming in SQL or Python, using the jQuery library of functions for more efficient programming,
       or using tools like Git for version control.</p>

    <h3>Build your portfolio</h3>
    <p>A riveting Web Developer portfolio that shows off your strongest skills is your best tool when applying for web development jobs.
         There are three things to keep in mind when building a portfolio that will stand out from the pack.</p>
